I had been oil painting, drawing, and producing things that had no purpose but their own, my whole life. Studying art and design seemed a natural fit. I went to college in Missoula MT where I studied fine art. The program wasn\'t a fit so I I came back to MN and studied interactive media, 3d animation, and post-modern theory at MCAD. I finished my BFA at MCAD and began making art and doing front-end dev work for ad agencies and freelance clients here in Minneapolis. Currently, I\'m a lead senior front-end developer with a creative approach to problem solving at azul seven in Minneapolis Minnesota.'},
